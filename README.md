The current project analyzes the World Bank dataset from a school quality improvement project in Ethiopia. The code attempts to convert JSON files ('data/world_bank_projects.json') into pandas dataframes, and answers the following questions:

- What are the top ten countries with the highest number of projects?
- What are the top 10 major project themes?
- How to handle data where project names are missing?
